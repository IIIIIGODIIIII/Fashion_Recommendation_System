Image Recommendation System using TensorFlow
This project utilizes TensorFlow 2.10 and Scikit-learn 1.3.0 to create an image recommendation system. The system is designed to take an input image from the user and recommend five similar images from the Fashion Product Images Dataset available on Kaggle.

Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to explore Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deep learning techniques. It specifically utilizes the ResNet-50 model, a pre-trained model from TensorFlow that was originally trained on the ImageNet dataset. By leveraging this pre-trained model, the project aims to understand how to use transfer learning for image recognition tasks.

Features
Utilizes the ResNet-50 pre-trained model for image recognition.
Recommends five images similar to the input image from the Fashion Product Images Dataset.
Utilizes Scikit-learn for calculating nearest neighbors for recommendation.
Target Audience
This project is beneficial for developers and machine learning enthusiasts looking to understand and implement image recommendation systems using pre-trained CNN models.

Technical Details
Python 3.9.0 is used for development.
TensorFlow 2.10, Scikit-learn 1.3.0, and the ResNet-50 model from TensorFlow are the primary dependencies.
Two pickle files trained on the Fashion Product Images Dataset are required for the system to recommend similar images.
Installation and Usage
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
cd your_project
Download the required pickle files from the provided Google Drive link.

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow==2.10 scikit-learn==1.3.0
Usage
Run the script for the image recommendation system:

bash
Copy code
python recommend_images.py
Follow the prompts to input an image and receive five recommended images from the dataset.

Examples
Example usage:

python
Copy code
# Python code snippet for using the image recommendation system
from recommend_images import ImageRecommendationSystem

# Initialize the recommendation system
recommendation_system = ImageRecommendationSystem()

# Input an image and get recommendations
input_image = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
recommended_images = recommendation_system.get_similar_images(input_image)

# Display or process recommended images as needed
print(recommended_images)
